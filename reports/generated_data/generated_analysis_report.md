## Key Findings

1. **Detection Capability**: The system successfully identified 23 parallelization candidates across 5 files.

2. **Confidence Assessment**: 69.6% of candidates received high confidence scores (≥0.8), indicating strong parallelization potential.

3. **Code Complexity**: Complex math operations showed the highest number of candidates (21) candidates, demonstrating the system's ability to analyze computationally intensive code.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: The system successfully identified various loop patterns suitable for parallelization, with vectorizable patterns being the most common.

## Methodology Notes

- **Analysis Mode**: LLVM-only mode (AI enhancement not active in this run)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-factor confidence assessment based on:
  - Pattern type (base confidence)
  - Code context (dependencies, complexity)
  - Metadata (hotspot priority, function hints)
- **Sample Size**: 5 representative files from different complexity categories

## Next Steps

To populate the comparative analysis reports:

1. Run baseline analysis (LLVM-only without enhancements)
2. Compare hybrid vs baseline metrics
3. Manual validation of high-confidence candidates
4. Performance benchmarking on selected candidates
