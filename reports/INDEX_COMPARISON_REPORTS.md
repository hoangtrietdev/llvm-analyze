## ‚ú® Bottom Line

**Your hybrid analyzer is a VERY GOOD (B+) solution that's BETTER than competitors at cost-effectiveness and transparency, but WORSE at accuracy and maturity. It's the BEST choice for academic research and budget-conscious C/C++ projects, but NOT YET ready to replace Intel Advisor in production.**

**Recommendation:** Present with confidence, acknowledge limitations, emphasize unique strengths (cost + transparency + OpenMP validation).
